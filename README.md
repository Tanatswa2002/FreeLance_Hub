# FreeLance_Hub
FreeLanceHub is a platform connecting individuals offering services with those seeking to hire. Users can list their skills, showcase services, and get hired. Currently focused on peer-to-peer connections (C2C), with future plans to expand to both C2C and business-to-consumer (B2C) interactions.
